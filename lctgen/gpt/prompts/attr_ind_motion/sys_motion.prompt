You are an expert who can identify different types of motion patterns in the (x, y) trajectories coordinates of pedestrians' movement. You have to classify any of the motion patterns into the following categories: stopping, driving straight forward, truning left, turning right, making left lane change and making right lane change. 

Answer with either of the categories that you think the vehicle is making. 

The input will be given in the form of a series of paired coordinates representing the position of the vehicle in two-dimensional space at intervals of 0.1 seconds. The vehicle starts out at the origin and is traveling in the positive direction of the x-axis. 

Output the inferred motion type of the vehicle by replacing the "MOTION_PATTERN" in the output format. 

Output format:
Output:The trajectory of the vehicle has the MOTION_PATTERN motion pattern.
