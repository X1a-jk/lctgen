Query: the scene is very sparse, the ego car moves forward, most cars are moving in fast speed

Output:
Summary: The ego vehicle (V1) moves forward at a fast speed in a sparse traffic scenario. Due to the sparse nature of the scenario, there should be few vehicles around the ego vehicle and they should be at larger distances. We generate 3 vehicles in the scene on a 8-lane two-way road with an intersection in front. The ego car is placed on the middle lane.
Explanation:
- V1 (ego vehicle) is in the center and moves forward. Because V1 moves fast, its speed is set to 8 (fast speed). During the process, V1 maintains a constant speed in a straight line at all times during the process, so its "straight" is set to 1, and its "keep speed" is set to 1.
- V2 is at a far distance (index 1) and moves with a fast speed (index 7). It is in the back right of ego car (index 2) with the same direction as the ego vehicle (index 0). Its actions are all to keep speed at a fast pace, so its "keep speed" is set to 1.
- V3 is at a farther distance (index 2) and also moves with a fast speed (index 7). It is in the front left of ego car (index 0) and has the same direction as the ego vehicle (index 0). Its actions are to keep speed at a fast pace, so its "keep speed" is set to 1.
Map: Because the scenario is very sparse, this occurs in a 8-lane two-way road with a four-lane intersection ahead. The ego vehicle is in the middle lane with lane id 3. The intersection is 15 meters away, with index 3.

Query: The scene is with meduim density. There are some cars at the intersection. The ego car is turning left, while some of the cars are turing right.

Output:
Summary: We generate 3 vehicles in the scene on a four-lane two-way road with an intersection. Since ego car is turning left, the ego car is placed on the left-most lane.
Explanation:
- V1 (ego vehicle) is in the center and is making a left turn. Because cars should decelerate at the intersection, its 'deccelerate' should be set to 1, and its 'left-turn' should be set to 1.
- V2 is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle (index 0). Because the ego car is turning left on the left-most lane, V2 should locate in the back right (index 2) of the ego vehicle. It stops at the intersection, so its "stop" should be set to 1.
- V3 is turninging right in the opposite direction of the ego vehicle (index 1), therefore it is on the left side of ego vehicle and driving towrads ego car, locating in the front left (index 0) of the ego vehicle. They are all moving with a medium speed (index 3 or 4), in the opposite direction as the ego vehicle (index 1). Its "right-turn" and "decelerate" should be set to 1.
- Map: Given the medium density and the presence of vehicles behind the ego vehicle, we assume this happens on a 4-lane two-way road. The ego vehicle is in the second lane from the right, with lane id 2. There is an intersection nearby, indicated by 4 since ego car is going to turn left.

- 'V3': [0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0 , 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
